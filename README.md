## Project(Project_ML-Model-Eval-Refine)
### Part of the Coursera series: IBM Data Science
    
## Summary
In this project, I took in data related to home sales in order to develop a model to predict future home sales.  We had to wrnagle the data and transform it, perform EDA and look at various correlations between features in order to set up a machine learning (polynomial linear regression) model on which to train and then create predictions.  We performed feature engneering and scaling in the process.
