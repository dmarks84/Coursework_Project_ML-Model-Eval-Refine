## Project(Project_ML-Model-Eval-Refine)
### Part of the Coursera series: IBM Data Science
    
## Summary
I used classification algorithms to create a model based on a set of training data and evaluated our testing data to determine the best model to use for prediction.  I used several algorithms (Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM).  I evaluated these models using Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R2-Score).
